<h1>Capitol Hound</h1>

<p>Capitol Hound is a searchable audio archive and alert system for N.C. General Assembly floor sessions and committee meetings. Using transcription services, Capitol Hound makes hours of audio from the General Assembly searchable by quote, allowing users to search for any phrase that may have been spoken in an N.C. General Assembly session. Capitol Hound can also send alerts when audio containing keywords you care about are found, with links to the exact moment the keyword is mentioned on the floor.</p>
